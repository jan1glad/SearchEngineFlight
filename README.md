As first, everything was done with using XAMPP on localhost and phpMyAdmin, also to start the website I have used Tomcat. Inside project there is a lot of not important things or mislead files, names because I was learning how to do the things I wanted. 
Maybe it's not perfect and could be better, but for a first major project somehow I am proud of it.
In the 'base' folder there are SQL files containing Flights, Cars and files for collecting data about customers. Without them the whole thing won't work. Also, everything is in Polish, but I think the main idea of using site is kinda clear. 
The start file is index.jsp
