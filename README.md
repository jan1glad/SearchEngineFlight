As first, everything was done with using XAMPP on localhost and phpMyAdmin, also to start the website I have used Tomcat. Inside project there is a lot of not important things or mislead files, names because I was learning how to do the things I wanted. 
Maybe it's not perfect and could be better, but for a first major project somehow I am proud of it. 
The start file is index.jsp
